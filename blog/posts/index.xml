      <description>When sending emails it is better for you and the recipient/s to send and receive images that have been resized.
If you try and send a large image it can take a long time for the email to send and when the recipients receive the email it can take a long time for them to download. Not to mention that some email providers have limits on the size of the attachments that you can send and receive.</description>
